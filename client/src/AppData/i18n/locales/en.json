      "desc": "Focusing on innovative solutions to strengthen national resilience, reduce infrastructure vulnerability, and build comprehensive preparedness for unexpected crises and threats.",
      "text": "Increasing national resilience to unexpected crises and threats is one of the most important strategic priorities of any country.\nGiven the environmental, social, and technological complexities in today's world, countries face a variety of threats and crises; from natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and storms to human crises such as infectious diseases, cyberattacks, and even military and security threats.\nNational resilience means the ability of a society to resist, adapt, and recover from critical conditions.\nThis resilience becomes meaningful when all of the country's critical infrastructure, including energy, transportation, communications, information networks, water and food supply, and health and medical systems, have an appropriate level of safety, flexibility, and support.\nReducing the vulnerability of these infrastructures to unpredictable events is one of the main goals of sustainable development and national security.\nOne of the most important components of this The field is the use of new technologies for monitoring, forecasting, and crisis management.\nThe use of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart early warning systems can significantly increase the country's ability to identify potential threats and respond quickly to them.\nAlso, the use of computer simulations and crisis scenario writing can help managers and decision-makers identify existing weaknesses and vulnerabilities and find practical solutions to reduce them.\nOn the other hand, promoting public culture and public education in the field of resilience is an integral part of this process.\nNo amount of technology and infrastructure can lead to sustainable results without community preparedness and public participation.\nCreating comprehensive preparedness means educating families, schools, organizations, and local institutions in the field of rapid response, first aid, resource management, and cooperation in times of crisis.\nAlso, cooperation between government agencies, the private sector, and Non-governmental organizations are of particular importance. Networking among various actors and establishing coordination at the national and regional levels ensures that resources are allocated quickly and correctly in times of crisis, and waste of time and money is avoided. Finally, strengthening scientific diplomacy and exchanging experiences with other countries can also enhance national capacities. Crises often do not know borders, and new threats such as cyberattacks or climate change require transnational responses. Therefore, participating in international networks and using global experiences, especially in the field of new crisis management technologies, can complement domestic efforts. In general, focusing on new solutions in this area means a comprehensive and multi-layered approach that ranges from technology to culture, from infrastructure to education, and from national management to international cooperation. The ultimate goal is to create a safer, more resilient and It is better prepared to deal with any unexpected threat."

      "title": "Innovation in Cybersecurity and Civil/Military Defense",
      "desc": "Developing advanced cyber and defense technologies, including intelligent systems, active and passive defense against hybrid threats and complex attacks.",
      "text": "Innovation in the field of cyber capabilities and defense, especially in the current digital age, is a vital necessity for national security and the protection of the country's sensitive infrastructure.\nCyber â€‹â€‹threats are becoming more complex and integrated day by day; in such a way that cyber attacks affect not only information systems but also vital sectors such as energy, transportation, finance, and even healthcare services.\nIn these circumstances, relying solely on traditional defense methods is not enough and we must move towards utilizing new technologies and developing intelligent systems.\nActive defense means using tools and methods that directly identify and neutralize attacks; such as smart firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS), and machine learning algorithms to discover attack patterns.\nPassive defense also means designing and strengthening infrastructures in such a way that they are least vulnerable to attacks; Such as distributed network architecture, data encryption, and support system design.\nInnovation in this area can include the use of artificial intelligence to analyze network traffic in real time, identify unknown threats, and predict future attack patterns.\nAlso, utilizing blockchain technology to ensure data security and increase transaction transparency is considered one of the new capacities in cyber defense.\nAnother important point is to pay attention to the security of end users, because in many cases, attacks are carried out through social engineering or human weaknesses.\nTherefore, education and raising public awareness in the field of cybersecurity is as important as technological development.\nCooperation between security institutions, universities, knowledge-based companies, and the private sector is also the key to success in this area.\nIn general, innovation in cyber capabilities and defense not only helps increase national security, but also promotes public trust, the sustainability of critical services, and the growth of the country's digital economy."

      "title": "Leveraging AI Capabilities in Crisis (All Domains)",
      "desc": "Applying AI and machine learning in monitoring, data analysis, and crisis forecasting to accelerate decision-making and effective response.",
      "text": "Artificial intelligence, as one of the transformative technologies of the 21st century, has provided humanity with extensive capacities for crisis management.\nIn critical situations, speed and accuracy in decision-making play a vital role, and artificial intelligence algorithms can identify hidden patterns and provide more accurate predictions by analyzing big data.\nFor example, in the field of natural disasters, machine learning-based systems can predict earthquakes, floods, or storms by analyzing meteorological and geophysical data and provide quick and effective warnings.\nIn the field of health, artificial intelligence can play a role in quickly identifying infectious diseases, modeling the spread process, and optimizing the allocation of medical resources.\nAlso, in urban traffic management during a crisis, deep learning algorithms can suggest optimal routes for evacuating the population or transporting relief forces.\nUsing natural language processing (NLP) in monitoring Social networks also provide the ability to analyze public sentiment and identify people's immediate needs. Another important application is the use of smart robots and drones for search and rescue, distributing medicine and food, and collecting field data. Combining artificial intelligence with the Internet of Things and satellite data can also provide a comprehensive picture of the crisis situation. Of course, the widespread use of artificial intelligence in crisis management also brings challenges such as maintaining data privacy, ensuring algorithm transparency, and preventing system errors. For this reason, the development of ethical and legal frameworks alongside technological innovation is of great importance. Overall, the use of artificial intelligence capabilities in crises can increase the speed of response, reduce human and financial losses, and improve the level of national preparedness."
